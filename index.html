    You are looking at the Rockstar Robots home page that we have created to show you how much fun you can have with legos. In some time you will see some pictures of the team working to make a robot or a lego structure we have built all together.We are a team of 7 totally rad kids working to build a robot. The robot might have to push a lever, pull an object, lift a lego, or even just rotate a lever made from legos. We hope this inspired you to start playing with legos or mabe join a team an be a real helper to your team. And most important of all have fun doing what you are doing with legos and building a robot that is programed to do some amazing thing. BYE!!
